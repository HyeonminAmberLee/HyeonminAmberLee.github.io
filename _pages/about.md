Hi. I'm a graduate student from [Computational Clinical Science Laboratory](https://ccs-lab.github.io/), in [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/), Korea. I received a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and and Social Welfare with Summa Cum Laude from Seoul National University in Aug 2023. I am interested in clinical psychology and mental health. I hope to identify psychological and environmental factors using digital therapy and the metaverse. I am also interested in computational methods that can be used to monitor and predict one’s mental health conditions.
