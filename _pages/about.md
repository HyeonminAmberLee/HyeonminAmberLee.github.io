Hi. I'm incoming graduate student from [Computational Clinical Science Laboratory](https://ccs-lab.github.io/), in [Seoul National University](https://www.snu.ac.kr/), Korea. I received a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and and Social Welfare with Summa Cum Laude from Seoul National University in Aug 2023. I am interested in clinical psychology and mental health. I hope to identify psychological and environmental factors using digital therapy and the metaverse. I am also interested in computational methods that can be used to monitor and predict one’s mental health conditions.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
